Implement Dynamical Independence computation for linear state-space systems, as described in:

L. Barnett and A. K. Seth, _Dynamical independence: discovering emergent macroscopic processes in complex dynamical systems_, [arXiv:2106.06511 [nlin.AO]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06511), 2021.

Please cite the above if you use this code in your work.

Requires the [Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC2) MATLAB toolkit](https://github.com/lcbarnett/MVGC2); set the path to the MVGC2 root directory in the environmental variable `MVGC2_PATH`.

Requires the [gpmat Gnuplot/MATLAB interface API](https://github.com/lcbarnett/gpmat); set the path to the gpmat root directory in the environmental variable `GPMAT_PATH`.

Requires the [gvmat GraphViz/MATLAB interface API](https://github.com/lcbarnett/gvmat); set the path to the gvmat root directory in the environmental variable `GVMAT_PATH`.
